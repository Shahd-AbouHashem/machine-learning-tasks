# üåü Machine Learning Internship Projects ‚Äì Elevvo

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Internship Repository**!  
This repo contains the projects I worked on during my **1-month internship with Elevvo**, where I explored **regression, classification, recommendation systems, and time-series forecasting** using real-world datasets.
